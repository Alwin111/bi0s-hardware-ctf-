so the task was to find the info in the secret.zip file. 
so i opened it on the wire shark and did some googling on 
how to find hidden messages using wireshark and i tried all
the thing that was showed in google and found one
i gone to statistics > conversions then i selected tcp files
i clicked on it and then i clicked on follow stream in that i found
some thing thats unique FLAG : d2lyZWR7eTB1X2YwdW5kX20zfQ.first i thought 
it was the flag but i wasn't then i thought of converting it then i 
came to know a site called base64 i converted it there and i got the flag
wired{y0u_f0und_m3}
