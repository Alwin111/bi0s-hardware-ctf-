on who to do this and i found out about brute force attack then from pcap file i searched for bssid 
command using  ctrl+f command and got a id-f6:0f:6c:4d:06:7c after that i used aircrack which is a a suite of
tools to assess WiFi network security including: monitoring, attacking, testing, and cracking
then i searched for the command the command was-aircrack-ng -w the_secret_flag.txt -b f6:0f:6c:4d:06:7c TOP_SECRET.pcap
