So i was given a pcapng file which has inability to store packets with different link layer types.
so i opened the file in wireshark and searched a file with unique difference and then i saw gattracker.txt
then i double clicked on it and saw {maybe some osint} i thought it was the answer but it was not then is saw 
[all hail king bluetooth] then i thought it was the answer but gain it wasn't then i got a clue from my friends 
they said to find everthing related to king bluetooth the i found were the bluetooth name come from which was
Harald Bluetooth so i typed that as flag and it was the answer
