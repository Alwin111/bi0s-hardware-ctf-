I This challange a ghost.log was given when i opened it 
it showed so many logs so i searched what Vcan0 is on chatgpt
so what Vcan0 is -The virtual CAN interfaces allow the transmission 
and reception of CAN frames without real CAN controller hardware.
so it not a cars but its rpm id so i searched for  Ford Mustang S550
rpm value and i got that in github what  Ford Mustang S550 rpm values is
which is 200 so i used terminal to open the file 
>cd Downloads
>ls
>file ghost.log
so to find a specific log i used grep function
then i found all the logs that starts with 200
which was all in hexadecimal i converted it into ascii values
so total there we 9 logs and the first 4 logs contained the answer
>the flag is=wired{3pst3in_d1dnt_0ff_h1ms3lf}
